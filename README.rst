omegle-bot
=============

EDIT: gotta use some sort of database client to add in empty JSON arrays for most vars, else it'll crash

Big paste from https://github.com/coal0/python-omegle/

Shitty bot with a shitty web interface around the Omegle API, allows proxies & uses the 2captcha API to solve captchas

No hate for trash code, literally pasted in under 30mins

Blabla sends conversations & allows you to replace variables in text, try it yourself

Getting Started
---------------

Requirements
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Go install all packages in requirements.txt (too lazy to link, half are probably default anyway)

Installing
~~~~~~~~~~

Simply run run.py after installing all requirements & browse to http://127.0.0.1:5000/
.. code:: shell

  python run.py

No tests, no licenses, go abuse this shitty piece of code
